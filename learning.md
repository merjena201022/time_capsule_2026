 What I Did
1. I used Python’s `input()` function to ask questions like:
- Current age
- Favorite song
- Biggest dream
- Best friend
- Favorite hobby
2. I learned how to *get today’s date* using the `datetime` module
I was surprised that Python can make a text file look so neat and formatted, almost like a real document.
